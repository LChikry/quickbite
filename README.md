  <strong>QuickBite</strong> is an extensible Telegram bot template for restaurants, enabling customers to browse menus, pre-order meals, and choose pickup or dine-in for a fast, seamless, <strong>and most importantly, line-free</strong> experience.
</p>

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Menu Browsing** ‚Äì Customers can view the restaurant's menu directly within Telegram.
- **Pre-Ordering** ‚Äì Allows customers to place orders in advance, reducing wait times.
- **Pickup or Dine-In** ‚Äì Customers can select their preferred dining option.
- **Extensible** ‚Äì Restaurants can modify the bot's source code to fit their specific business logic.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher**
- **Maven**
- **A Telegram bot token** (obtain from [@BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather))

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LChikry/quickbite.git
   cd quickbite
   ```

2. **Configure the Bot**:
   - create a `.env` file at the root directory and add your Telegram bot token and database connection information. For example,

     ```properties
     BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
     DB_PASSWORD=YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD
     ```

3. **Build the Project**:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the Bot**:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/quickbite-1.0.jar
   ```

## üìå Usage

Once the bot is running, customers can interact with it on Telegram to:

- **Browse the menu**
- **Place pre-orders**
- **Choose between pickup or dine-in options**

Restaurants can customize the bot's behavior by modifying the source code to add specific business logic or restrictions. Also, they will need to create a telegram bot and add it to the bot in order to receive customers order on that bot then react to it (accept, reject, notify, etc.)
